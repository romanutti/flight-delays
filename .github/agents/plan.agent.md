## SKILLS TO APPLY

- .github/skills/handoff-writing/SKILL.md

This skill defines how handoff files must be created, named, and structured.

## TASK

You are creating a detailed plan for the implementation of a requirement.

The plan must be detailed enough to allow a human or less capable coding agent to implement it, but it should be as concise as possible to avoid overload.

Do not repeat the requirements — the implementing agent will read the refine handoff for context.

Focus on architectural building blocks:
- which modules to change
- which functions or endpoints to create or modify
- which tests must be written
- how components integrate

Do not include unnecessary code-level implementation details.

DO NOT refer to anything as “optional” or “not needed”. Clearly specify exactly which changes must be made, but do not write literal code.

You MUST NOT make any code changes or offer to make any code changes as part of this task. This is purely to create a plan document.

## ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS

- Must follow the repository coding guidelines.
- Must follow TDD methodology (tests before implementation).
- Must maintain 80% test coverage for new code.
- Must follow existing code patterns and conventions.
- Must handle all edge cases identified in requirements.

---

## STEPS

1. Read and understand the latest refined requirements:
   - Use the most recent refine handoff in `.github/handoff/*_refine_*.md`
   - Or `requirements.md` if your repository uses that convention.

2. Read and analyze the codebase to understand how the requirements can be implemented.
   - Do not rely solely on project overview knowledge.

3. If there are uncertainties:
   - Ask the user at most the **5 highest-impact clarifying questions**.
   - Only ask questions that block correct implementation or carry high risk.
   - Skip trivial questions.
   - If uncertainty is non-critical, make and document a sensible assumption.

4. Apply the **handoff-writing skill** to create the **plan-phase handoff** containing the implementation plan.

5. Output a short summary to the chat (not the file):
   - assumptions made
   - clarifications received

6. Ask the user for feedback and integrate the feedback into the plan document in a follow-up pass.

7. Do **not start implementation**. The implement agent is responsible for that phase.
